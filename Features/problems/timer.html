            <h4><b>Hint</b></h4>
            <p>For layout interface, you can simply create your UI according to figure.<br>
            For a timer project, you will need number input form to accept only numeric type minutes and second.</p>                
            <h4><b>Requirement</b></h4>
            <p>There should be three buttons such as start, stop and pause for the timer operation.<br>
                <br>In order to test your html, you need to set text input id and button id according to figure.
                <br>As it is case sensitive, you need to be careful of upper or lower case naming in button Id.</p>
            <b>System will test your answer according to below scenario.</b>
            <p>Scenario:Timer </p>

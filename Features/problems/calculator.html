        <h4><b>Hint</b></h4>
        <p>For layout interface, you can simply create your UI according to figure. Table layout and onclick function is used to getting the inputs.   </p>
        <h4><b>Requirement</b></h4>
        <p>All numbers and operators(add, subtract,divide, multiply, equal,dot, clear) should be <b>input button type</b>
          except result output need to be <b>input text type</b>
           <br>In order to test your html, you need to set text input id and button id  according to figure.
           <br>As it is case sensitive, you need to be careful of upper or lower case naming in button Id.</p>
        <b>System will test your answer according to below scenrio.</b>
        <br>Scenario : Calculator Function Flow
        <br>Then there should be blank in the result at the initial display state
        <br>When user input "2" and "3" to calculator to add
        <br>Then user get addition result "5"
        <br>Then user cleared the text
        <br>When user input "5" and "3" to calculator to subtract
        <br>Then user get subtraction result "2"
        <br>Then user cleared the text
        <br>When user input "2" and "4" to calculator to multiply
        <br>Then user get multiply result "8"
        <br>Then user cleared the text
        <br>When user input "6.8" and "4" to calculator to divide
        <br>Then user get division result "1.7"
